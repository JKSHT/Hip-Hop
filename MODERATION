**MODRATION COMMANDS**

Kicking, Banning, Softbanning, Muting
All of these commands are very straightforward. The syntax for each is >>command <@users> [time] [reason]. All of these can be used on multiple users at the same time, and supports user IDs instead of mentions if you prefer. Banning and muting support time aspects, and users will automatically be unbanned or unmuted after the amount of time has passed (kicking and softbanning do not support times). The reason is optional but highly recommended as it will be used in both Discord's Audit Log as well as Vortex's Moderation Log.

**Examples:**

``h!kick @Looney#0001 @BeastInThaEast#0001 @Socrates#0001 raiding
h!mute @b1nzy#0851 @Shuu#0001 10 min Trolling
h!softban 103559217914318848
h!ban 120396406836953089 @Flam#0001
